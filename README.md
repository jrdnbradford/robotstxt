**Development version**

0.7.13 - 2024-08-27 / 16:49:41

**Description**

Provides functions to download and parse ‘robots.txt’ files. Ultimately
the package makes it easy to check if bots (spiders, crawler, scrapers,
…) are allowed to access specific resources on a domain.

## Installation

**Installation and start - stable version**

``` r
install.packages("robotstxt")
library(robotstxt)
```

**Installation and start - development version**

``` r
devtools::install_github("ropensci/robotstxt")
library(robotstxt)
```

## Usage

**Robotstxt class documentation**

``` r
?robotstxt
```

Simple path access right checking (the functional way) …

``` r
library(robotstxt)
options(robotstxt_warn = FALSE)


paths_allowed(
  paths  = c("/api/rest_v1/?doc", "/w/"), 
  domain = "wikipedia.org", 
  bot    = "*"
)
##  wikipedia.org
## [1]  TRUE FALSE

paths_allowed(
  paths = c(
    "https://wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/?doc", 
    "https://wikipedia.org/w/"
  )
)
##  wikipedia.org                       wikipedia.org
## [1]  TRUE FALSE
```

… or (the object oriented way) …

``` r
library(robotstxt)
options(robotstxt_warn = FALSE)

rtxt <- 
  robotstxt(domain = "wikipedia.org")

rtxt$check(
  paths = c("/api/rest_v1/?doc", "/w/"), 
  bot   = "*"
)
## [1]  TRUE FALSE
```

### Retrieval

Retrieving the robots.txt file for a domain:

``` r
# retrieval
rt <- 
  get_robotstxt("https://petermeissner.de")

# printing
rt
## [robots.txt]
## --------------------------------------
## 
## # just do it - punk
```

### Interpretation

Checking whether or not one is supposadly allowed to access some
resource from a web server is - unfortunately - not just a matter of
downloading and parsing a simple robots.txt file.

First there is no official specification for robots.txt files so every
robots.txt file written and every robots.txt file read and used is an
interpretation. Most of the time we all have a common understanding on
how things are supposed to work but things get more complicated at the
edges.

Some interpretation problems:

- finding no robots.txt file at the server (e.g. HTTP status code 404)
  implies that everything is allowed
- subdomains should have there own robots.txt file if not it is assumed
  that everything is allowed
- redirects involving protocol changes - e.g. upgrading from http to
  https - are followed and considered no domain or subdomain change - so
  whatever is found at the end of the redirect is considered to be the
  robots.txt file for the original domain
- redirects from subdomain www to the doamin is considered no domain
  change - so whatever is found at the end of the redirect is considered
  to be the robots.txt file for the subdomain originally requested

### Event Handling

Because the interpretation of robots.txt rules not just depends on the
rules specified within the file, the package implements an event handler
system that allows to interpret and re-interpret events into rules.

Under the hood the `rt_request_handler()` function is called within
`get_robotstxt()`. This function takes an {httr} request-response object
and a set of event handlers. Processing the request and the handlers it
checks for various events and states around getting the file and reading
in its content. If an event/state happened the event handlers are passed
on to the `request_handler_handler()` along for problem resolution and
collecting robots.txt file transformations:

- rule priorities decide if rules are applied given the current state
  priority
- if rules specify signals those are emitted (e.g. error, message,
  warning)
- often rules imply overwriting the raw content with a suitable
  interpretation given the circumstances the file was (or was not)
  retrieved

Event handler rules can either consist of 4 items or can be functions -
the former being the usual case and that used throughout the package
itself. Functions like `paths_allowed()` do have parameters that allow
passing along handler rules or handler functions.

Handler rules are lists with the following items:

- `over_write_file_with`: if the rule is triggered and has higher
  priority than those rules applied beforehand (i.e. the new priority
  has an higher value than the old priority) than the robots.txt file
  retrieved will be overwritten by this character vector
- `signal`: might be `"message"`, `"warning"`, or `"error"` and will use
  the signal function to signal the event/state just handled. Signaling
  a warning or a message might be suppressed by setting the function
  paramter `warn = FALSE`.
- `cache` should the package be allowed to cache the results of the
  retrieval or not
- `priority` the priority of the rule specified as numeric value, rules
  with higher priority will be allowed to overwrite robots.txt file
  content changed by rules with lower priority

The package knows the following rules with the following defaults:

- `on_server_error` :
- given a server error - the server is unable to serve a file - we
  assume that something is terrible wrong and forbid all paths for the
  time being but do not cache the result so that we might get an updated
  file later on

``` r
on_server_error_default
## $over_write_file_with
## [1] "User-agent: *\nDisallow: /"
## 
## $signal
## [1] "error"
## 
## $cache
## [1] FALSE
## 
## $priority
## [1] 20
```

- `on_client_error` :
- client errors encompass all HTTP status 4xx status codes except 404
  which is handled directly
- despite the fact that there are a lot of codes that might indicate
  that the client has to take action (authentication, billing, … see:
  <https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP-Statuscode>) in the case of
  retrieving robots.txt with simple GET request things should just work
  and any client error is treated as if there is no file available and
  thus scraping is generally allowed

``` r
on_client_error_default
## $over_write_file_with
## [1] "User-agent: *\nAllow: /"
## 
## $signal
## [1] "warning"
## 
## $cache
## [1] TRUE
## 
## $priority
## [1] 19
```

- `on_not_found` :
- HTTP status code 404 has its own handler but is treated the same ways
  other client errors: if there is no file available and thus scraping
  is generally allowed

``` r
on_not_found_default
## $over_write_file_with
## [1] "User-agent: *\nAllow: /"
## 
## $signal
## [1] "warning"
## 
## $cache
## [1] TRUE
## 
## $priority
## [1] 1
```

- `on_redirect` :
- redirects are ok - often redirects redirect from HTTP schema to
  HTTPS - robotstxt will use whatever content it has been redirected to

``` r
on_redirect_default
## $cache
## [1] TRUE
## 
## $priority
## [1] 3
```

- `on_domain_change` :
- domain changes are handled as if the robots.txt file did not exist and
  thus scraping is generally allowed

``` r
on_domain_change_default
## $signal
## [1] "warning"
## 
## $cache
## [1] TRUE
## 
## $priority
## [1] 4
```

- `on_file_type_mismatch` :
- if {robotstxt} gets content with content type other than text it
  probably is not a robotstxt file, this situation is handled as if no
  file was provided and thus scraping is generally allowed

``` r
on_file_type_mismatch_default
## $over_write_file_with
## [1] "User-agent: *\nAllow: /"
## 
## $signal
## [1] "warning"
## 
## $cache
## [1] TRUE
## 
## $priority
## [1] 6
```

- `on_suspect_content` :
- if {robotstxt} cannot parse it probably is not a robotstxt file, this
  situation is handled as if no file was provided and thus scraping is
  generally allowed

``` r
on_suspect_content_default
## $over_write_file_with
## [1] "User-agent: *\nAllow: /"
## 
## $signal
## [1] "warning"
## 
## $cache
## [1] TRUE
## 
## $priority
## [1] 7
```

### Design Map for Event/State Handling

**from version 0.7.x onwards**

While previous releases were concerned with implementing parsing and
permission checking and improving performance the 0.7.x release will be
about robots.txt retrieval foremost. While retrieval was implemented
there are corner cases in the retrieval stage that very well influence
the interpretation of permissions granted.

**Features and Problems handled:**

- now handles corner cases of retrieving robots.txt files
- e.g. if no robots.txt file is available this basically means “you can
  scrape it all”
- but there are further corner cases (what if there is a server error,
  what if redirection takes place, what is redirection takes place to
  different domains, what if a file is returned but it is not parsable,
  or is of format HTML or JSON, …)

**Design Decisions**

1.  the whole HTTP request-response-chain is checked for certain
    event/state types
    - server error
    - client error
    - file not found (404)
    - redirection
    - redirection to another domain
2.  the content returned by the HTTP is checked against
    - mime type / file type specification mismatch
    - suspicious content (file content does seem to be JSON, HTML, or
      XML instead of robots.txt)
3.  state/event handler define how these states and events are handled
4.  a handler handler executes the rules defined in individual handlers
5.  handler can be overwritten
6.  handler defaults are defined that they should always do the right
    thing
7.  handler can …
    - overwrite the content of a robots.txt file (e.g. allow/disallow
      all)
    - modify how problems should be signaled: error, warning, message,
      none
    - if robots.txt file retrieval should be cached or not
8.  problems (no matter how they were handled) are attached to the
    robots.txt’s as attributes, allowing for …
    - transparency
    - reacting post-mortem to the problems that occured
9.  all handler (even the actual execution of the HTTP-request) can be
    overwritten at runtime to inject user defined behaviour beforehand

### Warnings

By default all functions retrieving robots.txt files will warn if there
are

- any HTTP events happening while retrieving the file (e.g. redirects)
  or
- the content of the file does not seem to be a valid robots.txt file.

The warnings in the following example can be turned of in three ways:

(example)

``` r
library(robotstxt)

paths_allowed("petermeissner.de")
##  petermeissner.de
## [1] TRUE
```

(solution 1)

``` r
library(robotstxt)

suppressWarnings({
  paths_allowed("petermeissner.de")
})
##  petermeissner.de
## [1] TRUE
```

(solution 2)

``` r
library(robotstxt)

paths_allowed("petermeissner.de", warn = FALSE)
##  petermeissner.de
## [1] TRUE
```

(solution 3)

``` r
library(robotstxt)

options(robotstxt_warn = FALSE)

paths_allowed("petermeissner.de")
##  petermeissner.de
## [1] TRUE
```

### Inspection and Debugging

The robots.txt files retrieved are basically mere character vectors:

``` r
rt <- 
  get_robotstxt("petermeissner.de")

as.character(rt)
## [1] "# just do it - punk\n"

cat(rt)
## # just do it - punk
```

The last HTTP request is stored in an object

``` r
rt_last_http$request
## Response [https://petermeissner.de/robots.txt]
##   Date: 2024-08-28 21:00
##   Status: 200
##   Content-Type: text/plain
##   Size: 20 B
## # just do it - punk
```

But they also have some additional information stored as attributes.

``` r
names(attributes(rt))
## [1] "problems" "cached"   "request"  "class"
```

Events that might change the interpretation of the rules found in the
robots.txt file:

``` r
attr(rt, "problems")
## $on_redirect
## $on_redirect[[1]]
## $on_redirect[[1]]$status
## [1] 301
## 
## $on_redirect[[1]]$location
## [1] "https://petermeissner.de/robots.txt"
## 
## 
## $on_redirect[[2]]
## $on_redirect[[2]]$status
## [1] 200
## 
## $on_redirect[[2]]$location
## NULL
```

The {httr} request-response object that allwos to dig into what exactly
was going on in the client-server exchange.

``` r
attr(rt, "request")
## Response [https://petermeissner.de/robots.txt]
##   Date: 2024-08-28 21:00
##   Status: 200
##   Content-Type: text/plain
##   Size: 20 B
## # just do it - punk
```

… or lets us retrieve the original content given back by the server:

``` r
httr::content(
  x        = attr(rt, "request"), 
  as       = "text",
  encoding = "UTF-8"
)
## [1] "# just do it - punk\n"
```

… or have a look at the actual HTTP request issued and all response
headers given back by the server:

``` r
# extract request-response object
rt_req <- 
  attr(rt, "request")

# HTTP request
rt_req$request
## <request>
## GET http://petermeissner.de/robots.txt
## Output: write_memory
## Options:
## * useragent: libcurl/7.81.0 r-curl/5.2.2 httr/1.4.7
## * ssl_verifypeer: 1
## * httpget: TRUE
## Headers:
## * Accept: application/json, text/xml, application/xml, */*
## * user-agent: R version 4.4.1 (2024-06-14)

```

### Transformation

For convenience the package also includes a `as.list()` method for
robots.txt files.

``` r
as.list(rt)
## $content
## [1] "# just do it - punk\n"
## 
## $robotstxt
## [1] "# just do it - punk\n"
## 
## $problems
## $problems$on_redirect
## $problems$on_redirect[[1]]
## $problems$on_redirect[[1]]$status
## [1] 301
## 
## $problems$on_redirect[[1]]$location
## [1] "https://petermeissner.de/robots.txt"
## 
## 
## $problems$on_redirect[[2]]
## $problems$on_redirect[[2]]$status
## [1] 200
## 
## $problems$on_redirect[[2]]$location
## NULL
## 
## 
## 
## 
## $request
## Response [https://petermeissner.de/robots.txt]
##   Date: 2024-08-28 21:00
##   Status: 200
##   Content-Type: text/plain
##   Size: 20 B
## # just do it - punk
```

### Caching

The retrieval of robots.txt files is cached on a per R-session basis.
Restarting an R-session will invalidate the cache. Also using the the
function parameter `froce = TRUE` will force the package to re-retrieve
the robots.txt file.

``` r
paths_allowed("petermeissner.de/I_want_to_scrape_this_now", force = TRUE, verbose = TRUE)
##  petermeissner.de                      rt_robotstxt_http_getter: force http get
## [1] TRUE
paths_allowed("petermeissner.de/I_want_to_scrape_this_now",verbose = TRUE)
##  petermeissner.de                      rt_robotstxt_http_getter: cached http get
## [1] TRUE
```
